# DRL-for-COLREG-Compliant-ASV-Simulation
Project for the SoftUni's Deep Learning Course

## Abstract

Maritime transportation plays a critical role in global trade, accounting for over 80% of the world's goods movement. As automation advances, the development of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is becoming increasingly relevant for safer and more efficient navigation. However, ensuring that ASVs comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) remains a significant challenge.

This study presents a partially implemented COLREG-compliant ASV simulation, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), is responsible for navigating toward a waypoint while avoiding potential collisions. The agent is designed to handle static obstacles, head-on encounters, and crossing targets in a dynamic environment. Unlike many previous approaches that incorporate explicit waypoint tracking algorithms or cross-track error corrections, this implementation relies solely on a reward-based learning mechanism to shape the agentâ€™s decision-making process.

By leveraging a structured reward function, the ASV learns collision avoidance behaviors without predefined path-following rules, demonstrating an emergent compliance with fundamental COLREG principles. The study provides insights into the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in maritime navigation and highlights the potential and limitations of a purely reward-driven training paradigm. Further improvements and extensions, including enhanced optimization strategies and real-world applicability, are discussed as part of future work.
